Day 1 (14/01/2025)
---
Changed the ratio of my canvas to full screen.
Added a win condition (pickup Star) and a death condition (fall below canvas)
Added a main menu

Day 2 (15/01/2025)
---
Changed the ratio to the original one.
Fixed the win & death condition screen. (Didn't refresh the canvas and you couldn't see the character)
Added a hearts system. If you loose all 3 hearts you restart at the main screen.
Objects now move into the screen if they're outside of screen (but it's still a bit buggy)

Day 3 (16/01/2025)
---
Fixed scrolling behaviour.
Added basic UI for displaying hearts.
